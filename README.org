* Introduction to optool

This tool allows to produce complex dust opacities right from the
command line. It is derived from Michiel Min's [[https://dianaproject.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/data-results-downloads/fortran-package/][OpacityTool]] for the
[[https://dianaproject.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/][DIANA]] program, and committed to its simplicity.  For another derivative
of OpacityTool with a different set of applications, check out [[https://github.com/charlenelefevre/SIGMA][SIGMA]],
the /Simple Icy Grain Model for Aggregates/, by Lefévre et al. (2020).

* Capabilities

- stand-alone tool, fully command line driven, no input files need to
  be edited
- full scattering matrix output in various formats (including for
  RADMC-3D)
- combining materials through mixing into a complex grain with
  porosity
- DHS method to model shape effects and low-porosity aggregates
- a useful collection of compiled-in materials for standard applications
  in astronomy
- an easy way to use external refractive index data for more
  specialized applications
- multi-core support through OpenMP to make even complex computations
  very fast

* Terms of use


The code doing the real work of =optool= was adopted and modified from
[[https://dianaproject.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/data-results-downloads/fortran-package/][OpacityTool]]. I focused on the interface, on simplicity, and a clean
set of conventions. If you are using this tool, you should give credit
to the papers describing the methods used to compute the opacities, as
well as to the original laboratory papers that published the
refractive index measurements.
