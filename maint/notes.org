following format: The file may start with a number of comment lines
(lines starting with =!=, =#=, or =*=), followed by
- a line specifying the number of datalines $n_\lambda$ and the
  material density \rho[g/cm^{3}]
- $n_\lambda$ data lines with wavelength and refractive index:
  $\mathtt{\lambda_j[\mu{}m]\quad n_j\quad k_j}$
