* Actions and Ideas

** TODO Fix the FITS issues
Python cannot read the headers.  I should check if Fortran actually can!?
*** TODO propagate rho to fits and write it there?
** DONE Add an amorphous water ice
* Undocumented features
** Tools
+ =-b= :: Just interpolate and extrapolate the refractive index data
  onto the lambda grid, run the blender, and write the resulting
  refractive index to the file =blended.lnk=.  This gives access to
  the blending routines in =optool=.  For example, if you have
  laboratory measurments of a crystalline material, one file with
  measurements parallel to the c axis, and one with measurement
  perperndicular to it, you could create refractive index data for a
  1:2 mix of these materials like this:
  : optool -b para.lnk 1 perp.lnk 2 -l para.lnk
+ =-tex= :: Run =optool2tex= as part of the optool run.
